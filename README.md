You can view this course here: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-aspnet-mvc-5-course/

I had to do things on my own, learning how to do Code-First for this project here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/getting-started/getting-started-with-ef-using-mvc/creating-an-entity-framework-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application
